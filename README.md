#### Focus area: LCA

#### Role: Analyst Level 1

## Focus area and BIM use
Our use case involves creating a tool capable of extracting data such as materials, quantities, and EPDs from a BIM model. The tool then compiles the data into a .json file that can be directly imported into LCAByg. The file contains all the relevant information so a sustainability engineer can initiate a building LCA. 

In short, the goal of the tool is described as the following:
Streamline the process of conducting a building LCA from a BIM model by compiling all the necessary data a sustainability engineer needs. 

The tool was created entirely within Blender, utilizing the program's scripting prompt and the BlenderBim add-on. The script was developed exclusively in the Python programming language. 

## Role identification
Our tool is specifically designed for utilization by the role of “Analyst Level 1” since its primary objective is to analyze a standard IFC file and extract essential LCA data. This data would be presented in a comprehensive Excel-sheet overview, aiding sustainability engineers in their analysis and decision-making processes. However, due to its current limited LOD, the tool remains at Level 1.
